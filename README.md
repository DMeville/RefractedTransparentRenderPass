# WHAT
![gif](https://github.com/DMeville/RefractedTransparentRenderPass/blob/main/Example.gif)

Custom render feature for URP that allows transparent objects to show up behind glass (with refraction)!

# WHY

By default, unity uses the OpaqueTexture/SceneColor when doing refraction.  This texture is BEFORE transparent objects have been rendered, and because of this, transparent objects do no show up through glass. This is dumb. And while working on some water/waterfall things, I realized I rely on particles a lot, and don't want them disappearing when looking through waterfalls and stuff.
